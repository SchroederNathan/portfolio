I've also been looking to create software to track my habits with a similar system but hated having to pay for the apps I tried.\n\nSo I decided to build my own!\n\nI created Focus Grid to be a simple, easy-to-use habit tracking tool that allows users to visualize their progress using a Github contribution style grid.\n\nThis was my first time building a mobile app using React Native and Expo. Even though it was new to me, with my experience in React it was extremely simple to pick up.",
