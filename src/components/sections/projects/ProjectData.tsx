            "Our goal for this project was to create an efficient inventory tracking web application for H2M Staging that allows monitoring of warehouse activities, facilitating efficient planning and resource allocation. \n\n" +
            "Our approach involves implementing a backend system that seamlessly manages data, routing, and communication with the frontend. This simplified the development process of our server-side application using Angular, " +
            "ensuring smooth operation and interaction with the user interface. \n\n This web application offers real-time tracking of inventory movements, providing H2M Staging withaccurate data on warehouse stock and furniture distribution. " + 
            "By streamlining these processes, it enhances operational efficiency and provides valuable insights for the company's planning needs."
